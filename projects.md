**Description** 
As a team of four, I have been collaborating with my peers to create an online membership and class registration website for the Craft Center at Oregon State University. As of right now, the Craft Center completes all of their transactions through a paper-only system. It is currently my goal, with the help of my team, to create an easy and effective user interface for both the Craft Center members and employees.

**What I Gained From This Project**
Even though I have only recently started this project, I have gained a lot of great experience and knowledge from my work so far. I have learned the importance of communication with my project partner and stakeholders. I have also gained the skill of explaining technical goals to non-technical individuals, as this project is for creative artists of the Craft Center. This project requires me to work with technology that I am not as familiar with, which has helped get me out of my comfort zone and learn new languages that can help with my future career.
