### Oregon State University Craft Center Online Tool
```javascript
**Date**
Fall 2020 - Present

**Repo**
[Repository for this project](https://dev.azure.com/munafh/_git/CS461-Crafters)

**Description** 
As a team of four, I have been collaborating with my peers to create an online membership and class registration website for the Craft Center at Oregon State University. As of right now, the Craft Center completes all of their transactions through a paper-only system. It is currently my goal, with the help of my team, to create an easy and effective user interface for both the Craft Center members and employees. 

**Languages and Technology**
- ASP.NET
- React
- C#
- MS SQL
- Azure DevOps

**What I Gained From This Project**
Even though I have only recently started this project, I have gained a lot of great experience and knowledge from my work so far. I have learned the importance of communication with my project partner and stakeholders. I have also gained the skill of explaining technical goals to non-technical individuals, as this project is for creative artists of the Craft Center. This project requires me to work with technology that I am not as familiar with, which has helped get me out of my comfort zone and learn new languages that can help with my future career.

[Repository for this project](https://github.com/laurengalle/Movie-Website)

**Description** 
For this project, my team and I created a movie review website, Kernel. We used the different CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to create a functional website for the user to add and delete different movie reviews to the website. Any additions, deleteions, or updates were linked to the database for this project. I also focused heavily on the user interface for this project, where I was able to create and effective and please experience for the user.  

**Languages and Technology**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- MySQL

**What I Gained From This Project**
The main aspect I gained from this project was having to work with a database. I had to create a database from scratch and understand how to connect it to the website with all of the proper operations. I was also able to strengthen my front-end visual skills with CSS.

### Traveling Salesman Algorithm 
```javascript
**Date**
Winter 2020

**Description** 
This project involved trying to find the fastest alogorithm for the Traveling Salesman problem. My group and I used the Christofides algorithm to solve this probem. The implementation uses Primâ€™s algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree. This is followed by finding a perfect matching among vertices with odd degree. Then edges of the matching and the MST are combined into a multigraph. An Euler cycle is found in the multigraph by skipping over vertices that have already been visited. The Euler cycle is then put into the form of a Hamiltonian path.

**Languages and Technology**
- Python
- C++

**What I Gained From This Project**
This project was useful for me to better understand the different computer algorithms and how they can be ustilized for the fastest solution to an every day probem like the Traveling Salesman problem. I researched various different algorithms and worked with a team to help determine which one was the fastest and most effective.
